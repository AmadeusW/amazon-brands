# amazon-brands - Web extension that marks Amazon-owned brands

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmadeusW/amazon-brands/master/resources/logo-48.png) This extension prepends [AMZN] to search results that come from brands owned by Amazon, for example:

The list of known brands is maintained in `list.js`. Currently, its contents are taken from [this article](https://qz.com/1039381/amazon-owns-a-whole-collection-of-secret-brands/)

## To do

* Scan items as they appear in infinite scroll
* Perhaps this is no longer necessary since Amazon now adds "Our brand" next to some of its brands.
